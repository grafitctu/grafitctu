## Sheriff office
 On the beggining of game/story line the player will be shut in the cell and will be forced to co-operate with sheriff (because of that the player will be released). In the second cell is another prisoner - for more about story line take a look to story/dialogue directory.
 
 Much of the time the sheriff will be present in sheriff office or at the terrace of the same building except the specific events. Between these events belong night-sleep, lunch and on sunday when is time to go to church. 
 
 The another prisoner is shut in the cell all the time without any movement from sheriff office - the situation is changed, if the side quest from criminal is fulfilled.
