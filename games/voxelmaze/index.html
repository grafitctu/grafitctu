<p>In VoxelMaze each character aims to survive in a randomly generated maze in which the story takes place,
and conquer as many towers as possible, where valuable knowledge about the world of the characters is stored, and thus gain executive
technology that will save the world. The characters meet enemies along the way and bypass dangerous ones
traps. In the current version of the game there are 4 characters representing 4 different biomes (Sweet, Water, Robotand  Egypt) of one ancient civilization. The fifth biome (mMstic) is the biome of the dead sages who cursed
and hid the most important piece of technology in their tower.</p>
